# galg-computations

This repository contains a small sage/python program for pure math research in knot theory.

It finds upper bounds for the algebraic genus defined in the following paper:

> P. Feller and L. Lewark [On classical upper bounds for slice genera](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02679), Selecta Mathematica 24 (2018), no. 5, pp. 4885â€“4916.

Feedback via email to lukas.lewark@math.ethz.ch, as well as citations of the program, are highly appreciated.

While working on this program, Lukas Lewark was supported by the Emmy Noether Programme of the DFG, project number 412851057.
